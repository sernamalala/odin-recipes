<h2>Martha Stewart's Easy Waffles</h2>

    <p>A waffle is a leavened batter or dough cooked between two hot plates of a waffle iron, patterned to give a characteristic size, shape, and grid-like surface impression. Waffles are cooked until they become golden-brown in color, with a crispy outer texture and a soft interior.
    </p>  
    <p>Step away from your freezer: These easy, from-scratch waffles are so simple, you'll want to make them every weekend (maybe even on weekdays, too)</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour, spooned and leveled</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons (½ stick) unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>Maple syrup and butter, as desired, for serving</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Steps: </h2>
    <ol>

        <li>Preheat waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions. In a large bowl, whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt; set aside</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, whisk milk and eggs; pour over flour mixture, and whisk gently to combine (don't overmix).</li>
        <li>Gently whisk in butter.</li>
        <li>Following manufacturer's instructions, cook waffles until deep brown and crisp. (For a standard waffle iron, pour a generous 1/2 cup of batter into center, spreading to within 1/2 inch of edges, and close; waffle will cook in 2 to 3 minutes.)</li>
        <li>Serve warm, with maple syrup and butter, as desired.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>

    </ol>
