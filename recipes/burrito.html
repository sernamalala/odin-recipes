<h2>Mexican Style Burrito</h2>

<p> A burrito is a <em>Mexican dish</em> consisting of a flour tortilla filled with many ingredients including meat (most often beef, chicken, or pork), rice, cooked beans, vegetables (which include mostly lettuce, tomatoes and cheese) and condiments like salsa, pico de gallo, guacamole, or crema.</p>
<p>The term burrito means <em>‘little donkey’</em> in Spanish, possibly referring to the fact that a burrito has the tendency to hold many ingredients in it, similar to how a donkey is able to sustain a large burden.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Minced beef - 250g</li>
    <li>Red onion - 1/2</li>
    <li>Garlic cloves - 2</li>
    <li>Vegetable oil - 1 tbsp</li>
    <li>Large tomato (peeled and diced) - 1</li>
    <li>Tortilla wraps - 3</li>
    <li>Rice (cooked) - 1/2 cup</li>
    <li>Canned corn - 4 tbsp</li>
    <li>Kidney beans (canned) - 4 tbsp</li>
    <li>Yellow cheese (grated) - 5 tbsp</li>
    <li>Oregano (dried) - 1 tsp</li>
    <li>Cumin - 1 tsp</li>
    <li>Paprika - 1 tsp</li>
    <li>Black pepper - 1/4 tsp</li>
    <li>Salt - 1/2 tsp</li>
    <li>Sour cream - 1 tbsp</li>
    <li>Cilantro - for garnishing</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps: </h2>
<ol>
    <li>Begin by chopping the onion and garlic finely. Now, take a pan and heat oil in it at a moderate temperature.</li>
    <li>Throw in the chopped onion and garlic and sauté them until they soften. This should take you about 5 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Now, add the minced meat and, using a wooden fork, stir all the ingredients well. The wooden fork will help the meat attain a crumbly texture.</li>
    <li>Season the filling by adding oregano, cumin, black pepper, paprika, and salt. Make sure you stir all the ingredients well.</li>
    <li>The next step is to add the diced tomatoes, corn and kidney beans. Keep in mind to let it cook until the minced meat is tender. Make sure that most of the liquid has evaporated. This should take you approximately 15-20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Now take the cheese and grate it.</li>
    <li>Next, take a pan and start heating the tortilla wraps one at a time. Take the yellow cheese and position it lengthwise on every tortilla. Then place the prepared filling and finally add the cooked rice.</li>
    <li>The final step is to wrap the tortillas carefully by first taking the lower side and folding it, making sure the filling is still in, and then rolling them lengthwise.</li>
    <li>If you want, you can also add some sour cream and finely chopped fresh cilantro (or parsley) on top of each tortilla, and voila! Your burrito is ready to be eaten!</li>
